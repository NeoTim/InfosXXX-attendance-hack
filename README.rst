Background
==========

Around 2006, the company in question used a custom Windows server-client
application to ensure that the trainees weren't bunking the classes.

This application was clever enough and required the user to use both hands to
register his / her attendance. This prevented a user to give proxy attendance
for his / her neighbours who were sitting adjacently.

Many of my friends were smart enough to complete the daily training material in
under an hour (instead of 8 hours) and they were interested in doing other
"stuff". So, this application was written to solve their "problem".

It is quite possible that this hack still works ;)
